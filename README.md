# JModestMonoGame
For those poor souls forced to use Java and want to have something simple but reasonable to use for graphics. JModestMonoGame is a lightweight, barebones implementation of MonoGame (within the limitations of Java). The framework is built in Eclipse but can, of course, be manually compiled or imported into any other IDE. It is primarily intended for classroom use.
